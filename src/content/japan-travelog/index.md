My boyfriend and I took a trip to Japan this year. Here are some fun patterns we've noticed.

**Environment**

1. Tokyo is the biggest city in the world. It totally feels like it.
1. Lighting is spottier. Photos look naturally more dramatic.
1. Most building have businesses scattered across several floors.
1. Umbrellas won't help you when it Rains.
1. Early September means 90f, 100% humidity weather on average.
1. Ravens everywhere. They don't fear people and sift through trash.
1. Cicadas are, in fact, incessantly loud.
1. The deer in Nara will torment tourists when they smell food.
1. In Arashiyama, there are many signs warning to not piss off the macaques.

**Culture**

10. You can easily get around without knowing a word of Japanese.
1. Tokens, tickets, receipts, keys. Everything has its system.
1. People don't drink and eat while walking.
1. The word "Lab" is strangely common in brand and business names.
1. Hotels have humidifiers despite Japan being already mostly humid.
1. Umbrella swap-fest. People take each other's all the time.
1. Parasols are extremely common.
1. It's forbidden to take photos of construction sites.
1. Osaka's foot and bike traffic is a lot more chaotic than Tokyo's.
1. Drunk people actually fall asleep in Shibuya.
1. TikTokers sprint to the center of Shibuya Square to take selfies as soon as the crossing light turns on.

**Transportation**

21. The train system is elegantly and consistently designed.
1. Google Maps is exceptionally detailed and useful for transit.
1. Passengers will rather stand than occupy vacant priority seats.
1. On the escalator, stand on the right side and walk on the left.
1. The high-speed trains run every 3 minutes vs Boston's hourly commuter rail.
1. Bullet trains are absurdly smooth and quiet.
1. The ticket inspector bows to the cabin before entering.
1. Taxis are rather pricey but pretty much unnecessary.

**Food**

29. Almost every restaurant takes credit cards.
1. Reservations are a must over the weekend.
1. Tipping is not customary. No tip lines on checks.
1. Interaction between staff and customer is generally minimal.
1. Omakase is a very common experience, and not just for sushi.
1. Restaurant ads are hellbent on selling wagyu and kobe beef.
1. French patisseries are ubiquitous and excellent. [See this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/jcps35/comment/g933dp8/)
1. 3.5 stars on Tabelog's 5-star system means the food is excellent.
1. Starbucks is surprisingly decent.
1. Vending machines sell cheap, fresh food.
1. My favorite food was the curry at Hinoya in Akihabara for $8. My least favorite was McDonalds in Shibuya.

**Shopping**

40. There are a lot of Anker stores. No idea why.
1. Malls, malls, malls. 8-story tall, and most are deserted.
1. There are plenty of minimally concealed adult bars and stores.
1. Alcohol is dramatically cheaper than in the US.
1. Ads and jingle cacophonies all over streets and stores.
1. Lots of pet cafes, but Japanese animal welfare laws are lax.
1. Most otaku stores sell only merch of popular or sexy characters.
1. 7-Elevens are staggeringly clean and welcoming.
1. Most cafes don't open until 9am.
